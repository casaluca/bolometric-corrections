Bolometric Corrections and Synthetic Stellar Photometry 
-------------------------------------------------------

- ``BCtables.tar.gz`` contains tables of bolometric corrections for the systems described in Casagrande & VandenBerg (2014, Paper I).

- ``BCtables2.tar.gz`` contains tables of bolometric corrections for the systems described in Casagrande & VandenBerg (2018, Paper II).

- ``BCcodes.tar.gz`` contains FORTRAN programs and shell scripts to be used with the above tables. This set of codes supersedes that provided with Paper I.

For our programs to work, the content of the unpacked .tar files must be in the same directory (i.e., the directories within BCtables and/or BCtables2 must be where files from BCcodes are located). For instructions and examples how to use the computer programs we provide, please read the INSTRUCTIONS.txt file located in BCcodes.tar.gz

Please cite [Casagrande & VandenBerg (2014)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.444..392C) and/or Casagrande & VandenBerg (2018) if you find these packages useful for your research.
