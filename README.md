Bolometric Corrections and Synthetic Stellar Photometry 
-------------------------------------------------------

The programs and tables below allow users to compute bolometric corrections, synthetic colours and reddening coefficients for a variety of photometric systems (HST, JWST, SDSS, 2MASS, PanSTARRS1, SkyMapper, Tycho, Hipparcos, Gaia, Johnson-Cousins) given an input effective temperature, surface gravity and metallicity. 

- ``BCcodes.tar.gz`` contains FORTRAN programs and shell scripts to be used with the our tables. 

- ``BCtables.tar.gz`` contains tables for the systems described in Casagrande & VandenBerg (2014).

- ``BCtables2.tar.gz`` contains tables for the systems described in Casagrande & VandenBerg (2018).

For our programs to work, the content of the unpacked .tar files must be in the same directory (i.e., the directories within BCtables and/or BCtables2 must be where files from BCcodes are located). For instructions and examples how to use the computer programs we provide, please read INSTRUCTIONS.txt located in BCcodes.tar.gz
